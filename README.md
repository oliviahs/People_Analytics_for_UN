# People_Analytics_for_UN

This repository is about People Analytics Project for UNDP & UNICEF's staffs. 

The purpose of the project is to better support UN staffs' career management, so that the staff members can further acquire new skills, knowledge, and experience within and across departments, functions and duty station.  

It also aims to analyze whether the staff members have equal opportunities for service across the United Nations and whether there is a fair sharing of the burden of service in difficult duty stations.
